Garfield Research,Hudson University,"New York, NY",Statistician (under Dr. Andrew Garfield),2008,Present,"To reduce the time, cost and effort necessary to properly analyze a region affected by a natural or manmade disaster Dr. Richard Garfield and I worked on methods to show that smaller sample sizes can adequately provide the same information as larger sample sizes.  For our study we used data from the 2010 Pakistan floods that devastated large swathes of the country.  We compared varying samples sizes ranging from 5 tehsils (villages) in each province to full enumeration.  While the research is still ongoing we have so far demonstrated that as few as 10 tehsils per province is sufficient.  This should help improve future responses to disasters.",4,Research,Humanitarian Research
Garfield Research,Hudson University,"New York, NY",Statistician (under Dr. Andrew Garfield),2008,Present,"I was engaged in statistical and analytic support to Dr. Garfield of Columbia’s School of Nursing and Dr. John Mutter from Columbia’s Earth Institute in their study of the socioeconomic, health and geographic factors affecting deaths in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. We are reconciling a self-reporting death list with an official State list that is thought to under represent Katrina related deaths. The goal is to determine what disparities, if any, resulted in a greater proportion of deaths among certain populations as opposed to others. The analysis will result in journal article preparation in in which I will be one of the authors.",5,Research,Health Sciences Research
